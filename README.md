INTRIDUCTION


India is currently the world's third-largest producer of agricultural raw materials, roots and tuber crops, turmeric, potatoes, ginger, and a variety of vegetables. 
Agriculture is our country's backbone. Harvesting is the most important aspect of agriculture. In general, harvesting takes more time and a large amount of manpower. 
Harvesting underground crops such as turmeric, potatoes, carrots, ginger, and so on is a time-consuming process that involves reaping leaves and removing crops from the ground.In the olden days, harvesting of underground crops was done by using sickles which completely needs manpower. Later on, as technology developed different machines were invented. Farmers are currently using two separate machines for reaping leaves and removing the crop from the ground.



OBJECTIVE


Many advanced developments have happened in the agricultural sector. Various applications of agricultural technology can be seen in almost all stages of growing and harvesting crops. The major problem in agriculture are lack of machinery, unavailability of labour and time consuming process of manual harvesting. The objective of our project is to automate the methods of harvesting the tuber crops. They are mainly reaping, picking up the crop and collecting them. The system need not be monitored as it can work autonomously. The main advantage is that it can be used mainly in small scale and also large scale agricultural fields where farmers cannot spend huge amounts on labour as it is a one time investment . It is cost effective and can be portable.



MOTIVATION


In India over two-thirds of our working population are engaged directly on agriculture and also similarly depend for their livelihood. According to an estimate, about 66 per cent of our working population is engaged in agriculture at present. The introduction of autonomous system architectures gives us the opportunity to develop a complete new range of agricultural equipment based on small smart machines that can do the right device, in the right place, at the right time in the right way. Still there is a need to develop sophisticated root crop harvesters. The lack of suitable mechanical harvester for root crops is due to a number of factors such as the geometry of tubers in the soil at maturity, soil conditions and the high draught requirement of machines. Our system reap the leaves, removes all tuber crops and collect them using less power and without any human interference. This type of automation brings down the labor costs and improves the agriculture farm conditions which inturn yields good results.

PROCESS

Our prototype consists of a DC motor with two crossed blades, which are used for reaping the leaves. we use a stepper motor along with spokes for taking out the crop from the ground. The picked crop is moved onto the conveyor belt which is in vibrating mode. Due to the continuous vibration,  most of the mud gets detached from the crop. From the conveyor belt the crop gets collected in the bin and the ultrasonic sensor monitors the status of the bin and gives a  buzzer.
